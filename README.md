Hello! I am Verbena! a brazilian girl with way too many interests! I go by It/She!
Drawing is my passion and I love it dearly, though burnout has been quicking me and I have to get back to it.

Here are a few things I like: Drawing (my passion), woodworking, metalworking, computers!!! learning PCB design and tech in general (also aerospace things)

If you need to, you can reach me out via the email: home@verbenaidk.art
